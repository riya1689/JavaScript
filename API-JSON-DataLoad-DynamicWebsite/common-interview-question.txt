->Common REST methods:

GET → Retrieve data

POST → Create new data

PUT → Update/replace existing data

3.Can you use Get request instead of PUT to create a resource?
->No. GET is for retrieving data and should not change server state. PUT/POST are used for creating/updating resources.
 Using GET for creation breaks REST principles and caching mechanisms.

let obj = JSON.parse(str);
console.log(obj.name); // Riya

11.Tell us the difference between GET and POST?
GET

Used for fetching data.

Parameters sent in URL (query string).

Parameters sent in request body.

Not idempotent (repeating may create duplicates).

Not cacheable by default.
